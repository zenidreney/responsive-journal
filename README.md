# A Responsive Journay Using CSS-Grid

## This is a Solo Project of Scrimba Front-End Developer Course. I have kept the original from the Figma file provided and done the stretch goals.

## The site has 2 breakpoints. Single column layout for small devices, 2 columns for tablets and 3 columns for desktop.

## On small screens the MENU button is collapsable... also the view-more and view-less buttons. The JS is in the HTML as they are simple functions.
